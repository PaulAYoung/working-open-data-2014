% Day 9:  Creating Projects 
% Raymond Yee 
% February 18, 2014 (<http://is.gd/wwod1409>)

# Goals Today

* Start our thinking about [projects](http://rdhyee.github.io/wwod14/day01.html#(16)).

* Allow students time to continue working on the
  [Day_08_A_Metro_Diversity](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4739621) assignment.

# Projects

* Participants will work on tangible **projects related to the overall
theme**.

* The projects need to be thorough analyses of some open
dataset or datasets.

* Students can select from a list of projects or they can propose other projects
of comparable scope and intent. 

* Students will have opportunities to brainstorm ideas, choose a specific focal
point (drawing from structured feedback from other students and the instructor),
craft a proposal for their projects, and then present their work at the end of
the course.

# Project Proposals

[Due: Friday, March 14, 2014 11:59pm](https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1189091/assignments/4743884).

Write a 1-2 page proposal on how your group (of 2-3 team members) will conduct a thorough analyses of some open dataset or datasets. Use the following template for your proposal:

* Title
* Group members
* Problem Statement
* What open data sets might you be working with?
* Possible ties to Wikipedia (or any Wikimedia related projects)?
* What challenges do you anticipate running into?
* What skills will a team need to develop to solve this problem?
